Ever wanted to simplify the enrolment process for some of your courses by just auto enrolling users, based on actions they take within the system? This plugin helps you out with this, as you're able to configure which user actions should trigger a course enrolment for a user :)

Auto enrolment can be configured for the following scenarios:

* Auto enrolment upon course view

* Auto enrolment on login (new in 2.8)

* Auto enrolment upon activity/activities view

The plugin also allows you to configure a welcome message to be sent to the user upon enrolment.
